# Build and run the fs/wait syscall regression tests inside iSH.
#
# These pin the behaviour of five fixes so a regression fails here rather than
# in a user's shell:
#   #30  O_DIRECTORY flag value + O_NOFOLLOW honored at path resolution
#   #31  fakefs stat/fstat st_dev (nlink, blksize) agreement
#   #29  waitpid not reporting its internal 1s timeout as EINTR
#        waitid si_status/si_code decoding
#        waitid si_uid
#
# Usage:
#   tests/regress/run.sh [-i <ish binary>] [-r <rootfs>] [-f <fakefs path>]
#
#   -i  iSH binary to test. Default: the first of build-arm64-release/ish,
#       build/ish that exists.
#   -r  rootfs to run against, passed to iSH as -r. Default alpine-arm64-321.
#   -f  a file under a fakefs mount point (e.g. /var/minis/shared/doc.txt) to
#       additionally check stat/fstat agreement on. Only meaningful when the
#       rootfs is mounted with -f and a path-translate hook is installed, so it
#       is optional; without it the #31 assertions still run against the rootfs.
#
# The guest test binary is built with a cross-compiler (aarch64-linux-musl-gcc
# by default, override with $CC_GUEST). If none is available the script skips
# rather than failing, since the toolchain is not part of the repo.
