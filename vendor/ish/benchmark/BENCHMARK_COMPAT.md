# iSH Compatibility: x86 vs ARM64

> **Generated:** 2026-07-11 09:06:37 | **Tests:** 227 | **Host:** macOS 26.5.1
>
> Both architectures use **fakefs** mode with virtual device nodes.
> x86 rootfs = Alpine x86 minirootfs (busybox only)
> ARM64 rootfs = Alpine aarch64 full rootfs (apk, python3, node, gcc, go, etc.)
>
> All tests attempt to run on both architectures. x86 failures in the
> software/language categories reflect genuine 32-bit architecture limitations
> (no python3/node/gcc packages available for i386, or runtime VA requirements).

| Architecture | Pass | Fail | Rate |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **x86** (Jitter) | 212 | 15 | **93%** |
| **ARM64** (Asbestos JIT) | 227 | 0 | **100%** |
